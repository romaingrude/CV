## Skills :white_check_mark:

**Willingness to Learn**
* Throughout my professional journey, especially at Makers Academy, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and ideas. I thrive in fast-paced environments and am well-suited for the ever-evolving tech industry.
* At TikTok, I exhibited a strong willingness to learn and adapt. When new content management standards were introduced, I proactively invested extra time to study and understand these changes. By engaging with the IT department and participating in self-paced learning, I quickly became proficient in the new system. I assisted colleagues in navigating the changes, sharing my knowledge, and facilitating a smooth transition. My dedication to learning contributed to improved team efficiency and enhanced content safety.

**Team Player**
* I excel in team environments, bringing an agile mindset that enhances team performance and success.
* At Square Enix, during a peak testing period, I proactively offered support to overwhelmed team members. I assisted with various testing tasks, ensuring that all testing protocols were followed accurately and on time. I also helped address technical and gameplay issues, maintaining a high level of satisfaction among stakeholders. My collaborative approach and willingness to support the team contributed to our success.

**Problem Solving**
* A competent problem solver. At Square Enix, we encountered an unforeseen issue with localisation that required quick thinking and effective problem-solving. Realising the potential impact of this error, I immediately took ownership of the situation and commenced troubleshooting. I quickly identified several issues contributing to the problem: incorrect translations during the localisation process, a miscommunication between the localisation team and the developers, and a failure in the quality assurance process. Through this experience, I realised the value of maintaining meticulous attention to detail, effective communication, and a systematic problem-solving approach in a fast-paced tech environment.
* I have cultivated a keen analytical mindset that empowers me to approach challenges with innovative problem-solving strategies with a customer centric approach. Whether it's dissecting complex coding issues or devising creative coaching techniques, my ability to analyse situations critically and develop effective solutions has been instrumental in my professional journey.

**Attention to Detail**
* As a visual learner, I developed a strong ability to spot errors and inconsistencies through double-checking. By implementing this attention to detail in my work, I consistently improved the quality of content and saved time for the team.

**Growth Mindset**
* Demonstrated continuous learning and improvement.
